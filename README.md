🛒 Amazon Clone – Full-Stack Java E-Commerce Application

This project is a full-stack Amazon-like e-commerce web application developed using Java Servlets, JSP, Hibernate ORM, PostgreSQL, and a responsive frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It started as a frontend-only prototype and was later upgraded into a complete backend-driven system with authentication, product management, cart functionality, order processing, and database persistence.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate real-world enterprise Java development concepts such as MVC architecture, ORM mapping, session handling, database design, and REST-like controller flows.
